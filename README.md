# HackSprint 2025

This is a support repository for UAL x WiCS x NUL's HackSprint.

## Templates

Go to [bootstrap-templates](https://github.com/hm2412/HackSprint25/blob/main/bootstrap-templates) for basic templates that can provide you with relevant features. This directory is to help teams who are unfamiliar with web development or are unsure where to start.  
If you use a template, you will not be penalised, but **please** note this in your project pitch.

## FAQ

**What languages or frameworks can we use?**  
You are free to use *any* languages/frameworks. You are also free to use mobile app development tools over web development.  
If your team is unconfident, we would suggest easy web development frameworks like Bootstrap.
  
**What if we don't finish our project prototype by the end of the day?**  
A prototype is a great way to demonstrate your idea in action. However, don't overlook the power of a **good pitch**.
