# HackSprint 2025

This is a support repository for UAL x WiCS x NUL's HackSprint.

## Templates

Go to [bootstrap-templates](https://github.com/hm2412/HackSprint25/blob/main/bootstrap-templates) for basic templates that can provide you with relevant features. This directory is to help teams who are unfamiliar with web development or are unsure where to start.  
If you use a template, you will not be penalised, but **please** note this in your project pitch.  

## Submission
Submit your project via [Devpost](https://hacksprint-25.devpost.com/). Remember to create an account in advance and select your teammates – they will have been assigned to you.  
We suggest beginning the submission process from **4pm**, as there is quite a bit of information to fill out. Assigning a member of your team to handle submission is recommended. **Submission deadline is 4:30pm.**

## Task

Design, build, and pitch a website or app that you would have wanted when you began a **hobby or interest**.  

Whether it’s a financial planning tool, a learning platform, a progress tracker, or a social hub – this hackathon is about blending technology, creativity, and real-world problem-solving.  

Participants will need to build feature-rich prototypes, optimise for user experience, and prepare a pitch for their innovative solution. 

## FAQ

**What languages or frameworks can we use?**  
You are free to use *any* languages/frameworks. You are also free to use mobile app development tools over web development.  
If your team is unconfident, we would suggest easy web development frameworks like Bootstrap.
  
**What if we don't finish our project prototype by the end of the day?**  
A prototype is a great way to demonstrate your idea in action. However, don't overlook the power of a **good pitch**.
